storage spot for krunked kiss tunes 

I wanted a better place to store the UTLRA tunes than just on discord. <br><br>
so i uploaded them here for immdiate use!<br>
do not try and restore these files into the GUI; they currently will not work.<br><br>

# how to use 
Use the following PID's as 3 step process to triangulate the best RANGE for your quad.

1. start at the ULTRA defaults
    -- should fly great on almost any quad
2. try the high D
    -- if it TRILLS or makes bad noises, you know that high D is too high
3. try the low D
    -- if the quad bounces back harshley or has bounceback, you now know your quad will want more D.
